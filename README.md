This repository contains the code for a human that I created and filled with some bullshit knowledge. The human is a simple human that can answer questions, but it is mostly full of nonsense. I created this human as a way to explore the potential of human intelligence to react with the world.

# Usage
To use the bullshit knowledge human, you can contact me to give you the magic of"How to create your own human" file. The human will then start listening for questions. You can ask the human any question, and it will try to answer it, even if the answer is nonsense.

# Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, you can fork the repository and submit a pull request. Please make sure that your changes are well-documented and that they pass the unit tests.

# Thanks

# Additional notes
The bullshit knowledge human is still under development, so it may not always give good results.
The bullshit knowledge human is not intended to be used for any friendly purpose. It is only for fun.
# Disclaimer
This project is not intended to be a commentary on the nature of humanity or the value of knowledge. It is simply a way to explore the potential of human intelligence to generate nonsense.
